pyabiword (0.8.0-9) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Jonas Smedegaard ]
  * Update package relations:
    + Build-depend on librdf-dev, librasqal-dev, libgtk-3-dev (and not
      libgtk2.0-dev), libwmf-dev, libfreetype6-dev, libz-dev,
      libx11-dev, libexpat-dev, libjpeg-dev, libpng-dev, libxml2-dev.
    + Stop build-depending on libgoffice-0.8-dev.
    Above are (updates to) workarounds for libabiword-2.9-dev and
    libwv-dev lacking needed build-dependencies (bug#656252 and
    #656263).
    Closes: bug#655802.
    + Build-depend unversioned generally (needed versions satisfied even
      in oldstable).
  * Bump debhelper compat level to 7.
  * Git-ignore quilt .pc dir.

pyabiword (0.8.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update local CDBS snippets:
    + package-relations.mk:
      - Merge mixture of versioned and unversioned dependencies
      - Use unversioned dependencies when satisfied in oldstable
      - Improve whitespace cleanup
      - Rewrite and silence applying dependencies
      - Handle cdbs 0.4.53 dependency (needed when using debhelper v7)
    + upstream-tarball.mk:
      - Depend unversioned on cdbs (the needed 0.4.39 is in oldstable)
      - Preserve bzip2 tarballs with source format '3.0 (quilt)'.
    + copyright-check.mk:
      - More aggressive scanning (check top 99999 lines, not just 60)
      - Simplify more licensing notices and preserve non-ASCII chars
      - Group hints by sorted owner list (ignoring years)
      - Limit console output both horisontally and vertically
      - Use rev123 of draft DEP5 for hints file
  * Build unversioned on cdbs, thanks to CDBS dependency tracking.

    + Fix license section GPL-2+ to include verbatim GPL-reference text.

      py-compile, not postal address as common in other (older?) cases).
      Place the website reference below Debian-specific reference to
      actual license file, to slightly emphasize that it is a local edit
      (not copied verbatim from an upstream file).
  * Include examples dir as, well, examples.
